# Global Announcements for Management Wanted
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Use CONDITION: to specify when announcements should show
# Available variables: {MOD_VERSION}, {PLAYER}, {DATE}, {TIME}, etc.
# MOD VERSION is determined in CustomMainMenuScreen.java so if I forget to change it then oops -Chris
